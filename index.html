        <b>
            <p1>The Fazlani L’Academie Globale (FLAG) is a new-era international school sited in Mazgaon, a former Portuguese enclave in mid-town Mumbai. Its contemporary, child-friendly campus is designed by celebrity architect Hafeez Contractor. A wholly international K-12 school, FLAG is affiliated with the offshore Cambridge Assessment International Education (CAIE), UK and International Baccalaureate (IB), Geneva exam boards. Currently, this progressive outward-looking school has 592 students including 230 girls, mentored by 92 well-qualified teachers on its muster rolls.

                Established in 2007 by Dr. A.K. Fazlani, promoter-director of the Mumbai-based Fazlani Group, one of India’s top food processing, distribution and export conglomerates (annual revenue: Rs.2,000 crore), FLAG was promoted with the objective of nurturing national and global leaders with “love for life-long learning”.

                Although it was founded only 11 years ago, FLAG is ranked among Maharashtra’s Top 15 international day schools in the EducationWorld India School Rankings 2017-18.

                Dr. A.K. Fazlani, Chairman

                A pioneer businessman and philanthropist, Dr. Fazlani, awarded a Ph D in international business by Asbury University, USA, started a modest family business in tobacco and related products in 1971, which was developed into one of the largest tobacco export companies of India. In 1980, he promoted the Fazlani Foundation which has since registered nine charitable trusts focused upon education and health. In 2007, he promoted the state-of-the-art Fazlani L’acadamie Globale to provide students in the Mazgaon neighbourhood internationally benchmarked school education. “I believe the goal of life’s journey is not to arrive, but to keep pressing onward,” he says.

                Campus Infrastructure

                FLAG’s campus is designed to facilitate experiential and collaborative learning. The school’s five-storied building with a built-up area of 28,035 sq. ft features 30 student-friendly classrooms, art and music rooms, three science laboratories, and several designated spaces for co-curricular and extra-curricular activities.

                Co-curricular and Sports Education

                Students are encouraged to participate in a wide array of co-curricular and extra-curricular activities. The school is equipped with modern performing arts and sports facilities including dedicated art and music rooms, two multipurpose areas for roller skating, table tennis, chess and gymnastics. A neighbouring public sports ground is accessible for field games such as football, cricket and hockey.

                STUDENTS COMMENTS

                “At Fazlani L’ Academie Globale, I have learnt to overcome my inhibitions, and become expressive and confident. The excellent faculty ensures that the academic programme is delivered in an engaging and challenging manner to aid our learning and understanding.” – Aisha Tinwala, class XII

                “I distinctly remember my first day at FLAG — I was a shy, quiet and reserved student. Pushing me out of my comfort zone, and by encouraging me to try out new things, the school’s faculty has helped me grow into a confident and responsible individual. Opportunities such as being on the school’s newsletter editorial board and the Annual Day organising team enabled me to develop my communication and teamwork skills.” – Ambreen Shaikh, class XI

                Class I student Vedant Mistry won two gold and one silver medals in the Under-5 category in the 10th National Sendo Ryu Karate Tournament, 2015.

                The school’s football team participated in the International Youth Football Tournament 2015, staged in Kaposvar, Hungary.
